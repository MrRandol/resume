  "ubisoft_summary": "Within the Hyperscape team, I worked on the game admin backoffice web tools. I had a big focus on season data management, mostly to offer the team members an easy and fast way to build season content while preserving data coherence. \n\nI worked on features development for the backoffice (full stack), data deployment with python, the CI system (gitlabci, docker, openapi...), or the service deployment on the infrastructure with kubernetes.",

  "sii_summary": "SII Canada is a new branch of the French company SII. Before joining the DevOps Squad at the BNC, I had the opportunity to build a new development forge internally. Entering the BNC, I took a hybrid role, mix of the catalyst and the integrator. As a Catalyst, I coach and advise teams regarding their processes, technologies or priorities regarding the development and release process. As an integrator, I actively help them implementing those changes and bring an expertise on technologies helping them transform into the DevOps mindset.",

  "nalys_internal_summary": "My last mission with Nalys was to design an internal Proof of Concept consisting of an on premise kubernetes cluster. Its goal was to be the central hub to deploy internal applications such as the development forge or the new projects that were in development.",
  "nalys_graduate_program_summary": "While being at ING, I was given the opportunity to train a group of students around Agile and DevOps during the Graduate Program, a 3 months training set by Nalys for new employees who just graduated.\nI elaborated and shared this training around theory and workshops to empower the trainees to Agile and DevOps mindset, culture and processes.",
  "nalys_ing_summary" : "My role in the ING organization was to support 2 teams in their development and release processes. I was taking care of the development environment to help developers on their day to day tasks, but also looking into the release and feedback processes (testing, automatic deployments on non prod environments...). This helped improve the overall project quality and stability, on which I could build to also improve the team organization to empower developers and give them more responsibility.\nPart of my mission was also to migrate the CI/CD stack on the new centralized SaaS solution. (Gitlab & Jenkins onto TFS).",
  "nalys_gim_summary": "At GIM I was given the mission to help a development team deliver a project to production. I could help in 2 ways :\n\nFirst by being part of the developers by contributing to the features of the frontend OpenLayers map. Also, by refactoring the integration and deployment process, removing pain points and manual tasks that were hurting the team productivity and the project efficiency. Finally, I spent some time training the team to some development best practices, such as git feature branching and pull requests.",

  "worldline_project_manager_summary": "As I built leadership in the Géoportail project, I decided to take the role of project manager on the evolutions scope. At Worldline, a project manager is half way between the traditional project manager and the developer, allowing me to continue working very closely within the team on the same tasks, but also to take a step back and work on planning, priorities and costs. This role gave me the opportunity to work closer with the client and consolidate the partnership relation we already had, giving me more responsibility over the project direction. I then worked with my teammates to improve the organization and continue transforming the way we were working to further improve the project quality.",
  "worldline_application_manager_summary": "When the Géoportail project went live, I gained a position in the maintenance team in charge of the project run, but also to continue the development of features delayed from the initial scope. As a team we all started implementing Agile and DevOps processes and concept (Kanban, release normalization, automation...) to improve little by little the quality of the project and the speed of delivery. With time I took a lead in the team on subjects like architecture and issues around GIS, allowing me to work more actively on the conception of feature closely with the client.",
  "worldline_flex_summary": "I started at Worlldine as an intern on the «Géoportail» project as a Flex developer on the frontend map component. By working on new features, I learned the norms and work with geographic data in IT. In parallel, I also worked on 2 Flex components for the online shop to display maps. They were used to display paper map extents and to create a fully customized paper map.",

  "captive_studio_summary": "In this development team of a communication agency, I realized several Ruby On Rails projects, either from the beginning or to continue developing existing ones.",
